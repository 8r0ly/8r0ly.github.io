    <pre><b>About:</b>
Hello, I am Tarun Rathore, a University Post Graduate, with a software developer background, specialized in web development, including frontend and backend. In my University years, I started reading productivity books/articles and realized that every objective needs to have a deadline so other tasks should not suffer. Other than reading as a hobby, I have earned multiple certifications on various languages and frameworks, including, C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap. I am looking forward to learn more from professionals one-on-one as well as gettin hands-on experience by working in the industry.
